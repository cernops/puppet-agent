## This works around an issue with the OSX service names in
## puppet-agent. We're using a short service name intead of
## the fully qualified name (puppet instead of com.puppetlabs.puppet)

## Putting this workaround here until we can fix the service names in
## the next major version, at which point the more generic logic in
## vanagon will do the right thing

if [ -n "$foundpkg" ]; then
  for service in "puppet" "mcollective" "pxp-agent" ; do
    if /bin/launchctl list "${service}" &> /dev/null; then
      touch "/tmp/.puppet-agent.upgrade/${service}"
      /bin/launchctl unload "/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.puppetlabs.${service}.plist"
    fi
  done
